# Usage: ./TEST_BMS N benchmarks Name Args
#
# Runs each benchmark N times with the given Args.  Name is used for output files.
# Produces log files log/Name-bm.out and summary file Name.csv
#
# Examples:
#        ./TEST_BMS 20 crypt:lufact FastTrack -tool=FT2 -quiet -maxWarn=1
#        ./TEST_BMS 20 all FastTrack -tool=FT2 -quiet -maxWarn=1
#        ./TEST_BMS 20 none FastTrack
#
# The second and third are short-hands to run all and none of the bms.
#
#
# Note: You will want to run this script multiple times and 
# aggregate the results.
