Nov 19, 2014: Various bug fixes and memory performance improvements.
              These include: more gracefully recovery from various 
              failures, a more robust fastpath process for array 
              accesses, and improved handling of shadow state for 
              volatiles and threads.

Aug 30, 2014: This is a large update:

              Various bug fixes.  This includes corner cases in FT_CAS,
              the instrumentor, and the shadow state representation of 
              arrays (most notably in long-running programs with large
              heap sizes --- see ArrayStateFactory.java).
              
              Arrays are now tracked in fine-grained mode by default
              rather than being untracked by default.
              
              Performance: RoadRunner's shadow state could pin 
              down objects that otherwise could be collected.  All Shadow
              State objects (ShadowVolatile, ShadowLock, ArrayState, ...)
              now refer back to real state via WeakReferences to avoid
              such issues.  Some caches for array states do not use
              weak references to avoid a run-time performance hit, but
              could perhaps be improved in some additional way in the
              future.
              
              Tools can now have more specialized fast path methods for
              array and field accesses.  See Tool.java.

July 8, 2014: Various small changes and bug fixes in instrumentation.
              
              New experimental CAS-based updaters.
              
              Updated to ASM version 5 and moved it into the rr package 
              to enable targets using ASM to be properly loaded.
              
Jan 9, 2012:  Fixed typo in message reporting code for HB tool.

Jan 6, 2012:  Committed change for -lines option.  It now applies to
              array ops, field ops, but not lock ops.  It seems more
              useful this way.

Jan 5, 2012:  Committed change for -lines option.  It now applies to
              array ops, field ops, and lock acquire/release.
  

Oct 3, 2011:  Committed and pushed small code edits from various places.
              There were some conflicts that should have been resolved 
              correctly.  If problems exist, please use the version from
              June 20.
